    /// ** General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition **
    ///
    /// Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:
    /// "ISO-8859-8" - Visual Hebrew
    /// "windows-1255" - Logical Hebrew 
    /// "ISO-8859-8-I" - Logical Hebrew
    /// "x-mac-hebrew" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??
    ///
    /// Both "ISO" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas
    /// "windows-1255" and "x-mac-hebrew" are two different proper supersets of 
    /// these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range
    /// 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific 
    /// diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.
    /// x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different 
    /// mapping.
    ///
    /// As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four 
    /// charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the 
    /// main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters 
    /// (including final letters).
    ///
    /// The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.
    /// "Visual" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is
    /// not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and 
    /// draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read 
    /// backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:
    /// "[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards
    /// and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards] 
    /// [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' "
    /// adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is
    /// naturally also "visual" and from left to right.
    /// 
    /// "Logical" directionality means the text is ordered "naturally" according to
    /// the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display 
    /// the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general 
    /// punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.
    ///
    /// Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From 
    /// what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality
    /// is Logical.
    ///
    /// To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two
    /// charsets:
    /// Visual Hebrew - "ISO-8859-8" - backwards text - Words and sentences are
    ///    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes
    ///    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even 
    ///    word order is unimportant).
    /// Logical Hebrew - "windows-1255" - normal, naturally ordered text.
    ///
    /// "ISO-8859-8-I" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be 
    ///    specifically identified.
    /// "x-mac-hebrew" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew
    ///    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with
    ///    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might
    ///    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact
    ///    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't 
    ///    worth the effort and performance hit.
    ///
    /// *** The Prober ***
    ///
    /// The prober is divided between two nsSBCharSetProbers and an nsHebrewProber,
    /// all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the
    /// nsSBCSGroupProber. The two nsSBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in
    /// fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which
    /// one is it is made by the nsHebrewProber by combining final-letter scores
    /// with the scores of the two nsSBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.
    ///
    /// The nsSBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML
    /// tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces
    /// and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.
    /// The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in
    /// high-ASCII.
    /// The two nsSBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:
    /// Win1255Model.
    /// The first nsSBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other
    /// nsSBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was
    /// built. The second nsSBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter
    /// lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates
    /// a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.
    ///
    /// The nsHebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for
    /// final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual
    /// Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the nsHebrewProber
    /// alone are meaningless. nsHebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence
    /// since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the
    /// nsHebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper "Name Prober".
    /// When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,
    /// it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a
    /// Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the
    /// nsHebrewProber to make the final decision. In the nsHebrewProber, the
    /// decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both
    /// model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the
    /// charset identified, either "windows-1255" or "ISO-8859-8".
